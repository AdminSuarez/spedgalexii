# SpEdGalexii Pitch Deck Template

> Working title: **SpEdGalexii** – IEP Accommodations Mission Control
>
> Design note: Match the live app — use a dark galaxy background, bright accent color for headings (same as Orbit Hub primary), rounded cards, and clean sans-serif fonts.

---

## Slide 1 – Title / Hero

- **Title:** SpEdGalexii – IEP Accommodations Mission Control
- **Subtitle:** From scattered files to one launchpad for IEP compliance
- **Visual:**
  - Full-bleed galaxy/space gradient background (same as Orbit Hub)
  - Large logo or wordmark matching the app header
  - Optional: Screenshot of Orbit Hub hero area framed on a laptop mockup
- **Footer:** Your name, title, district/organization, date

Speaker notes:
- 1–2 sentences on who this is for (SpEd directors, coordinators, campus admins).
- Emphasize that this is not just another dashboard – it is a mission-control style workspace.

---

## Slide 2 – The Problem: IEP Accommodations Chaos

- **Title:** The reality today: scattered, manual, risky
- **Bullets (pick 3–5):**
  - Accommodations live in **multiple systems** (IEP platform, spreadsheets, PDFs).
  - **Testing accommodations** are hard to reconcile with what’s in TestHound / assessment platforms.
  - Case managers spend **hours hunting** for the right document and version.
  - Leaders lack a **single source of truth** for audits and compliance.
  - High risk of **missed accommodations** on state assessments.
- **Visual:**
  - Simple icons showing many disconnected tools feeding into a frustrated teacher/admin.

Speaker notes:
- Ground the story in how your users actually feel today ("email archaeology", "binder of doom").

## Slide 3 – Our Mission: One Orbit, Zero Guesswork

- **Title:** Our mission: one orbit, zero guesswork
- **Key message:** Bring all IEP accommodations into a single, auditable workspace.
- **3–4 pillars:**
  - **Orbit Hub:** Mission control for all IEP and testing data.
  - **Deep Space:** Deep-dive analysis of IEP documents and goals.
  - **Ask Galexii:** AI copilot for case managers and SpEd leaders.
  - **Compliance Reports:** Clear, exportable evidence for audits.
- **Visual:**
  - Orbit-style diagram: Orbit Hub in the center, with Deep Space / Ask Galexii / Reports as satellites.

Speaker notes:
- Connect each pillar to a pain point from the previous slide.

## Slide 4 – Orbit Hub: Mission Control

- **Title:** Orbit Hub – everything in one place
- **Bullets:**
  - Single launchpad for running all accommodations audits.
  - Clear cards for **Assessments**, **Services**, **Goals**, **PLAAFP**, etc.
  - "Run All" controls to execute end-to-end audits from one screen.
  - No more hunting for scripts or remembering command lines.
- **Visual:**
  - Screenshot of the live Orbit Hub page
  - Callout annotations around key cards and the Run All control.

Speaker notes:
- Tell the story of a case manager sitting down and immediately seeing what they need to do.

## Slide 5 – Deep Space: Deep-Dive IEP Analysis

- **Title:** Deep Space – send IEPs for deep analysis
- **Bullets:**
  - Upload IEP PDFs and related documents directly into Deep Space.
  - Handles **large files** using modern storage (Vercel Blob) behind the scenes.
  - Python-based analyzers generate structured JSON and narrative reports.
  - Surfaces **gaps, mismatches, and missing links** between IEPs and assessments.
- **Visual:**
  - Screenshot of the Deep Space page showing file upload and results.
  - Side panel mock with a sample IEP insights report.

Speaker notes:
- Emphasize that Deep Space is doing the heavy lifting so humans can focus on decisions.

## Slide 6 – Ask Galexii: AI Copilot for SpEd

- **Title:** Ask Galexii – AI that understands your orbit
- **Bullets:**
  - Floating chat that’s always available on top of the app.
  - Larger, readable panel for long responses (matching the updated UI).
  - Context-aware: can be wired to student data and audit results.
  - **"Need a human?"** button to ping a real expert when AI isn’t enough.
- **Visual:**
  - Screenshot or mock of the Galexii chat panel with a sample Q&A.
  - Highlight the "Need a human?" support option.

Speaker notes:
- Position Galexii as a copilot, not a replacement – AI plus human support.

---

## Slide 7 – End-to-End Workflow

- **Title:** How it works: from data to decisions
- **3–4 step flow:**
  1. **Ingest:** Connect or import from TestHound, IEP exports, and rosters.
  2. **Analyze:** Run audits via Orbit Hub and Deep Space.
  3. **Explain:** Use Ask Galexii and narrative summaries to clarify results.
  4. **Act:** Export clean reports and take action with campuses and case managers.
- **Visual:**
  - Horizontal process diagram with icons for each step.

Speaker notes:
- Tell a concrete story of a specific student or campus going through the flow.

## Slide 8 – Results & Impact

- **Title:** Impact: time saved, risk reduced
- **Metrics (adjust to your real numbers):**
  - **X%** reduction in time spent on accommodation audits.
  - **Y hours** saved per case manager per month.
  - **Z%** fewer missing accommodations discovered during assessments.
  - Stronger documentation and evidence for state audits.
- **Visual:**
  - Simple bar/line charts or before/after comparison.

Speaker notes:
- Plug in real or projected numbers, even if approximate, and a short anecdote.

## Slide 9 – For Whom & Where It Fits

- **Title:** Who this is for
- **Segments:**
  - District and campus **SpEd directors/coordinators**.
  - **Assessment & testing** coordinators.
  - **Principals and APs** responsible for compliance.
- **Integration / fit:**
  - Works alongside your IEP platform and test systems.
  - Focused on **accommodations visibility and alignment**, not replacing SIS/IEP.

Speaker notes:
- Clarify that this slots into the existing ecosystem instead of trying to replace everything.

---

## Slide 10 – Implementation & Safety

- **Title:** Implementation, security, and data safety
- **Bullets:**
  - Built on **Next.js**, modern web stack, and secure APIs.
  - Uses **cloud storage** and **role-based access** to protect student data.
  - Clear separation between **production** and **sandbox** environments.
  - Can align with district privacy and data handling policies.
- **Visual:**

Speaker notes:
- Match this slide to your actual infrastructure and policies.

---

## Slide 11 – Pricing / Pilot Options

- **Title:** Pilot pathways and pricing
- **Content (customize as needed):**

## Slide 12 – Roadmap & Vision

- **Title:** Where we’re headed next
- **Possible roadmap items:**
  - Deeper integrations with IEP platforms and testing tools.

Speaker notes:
- Show that this is a living platform that will grow with districts.

---

## Slide 13 – Call to Action

- **Title:** Ready for launch?

## How to Use This Template

- Treat each markdown section as a slide when building your deck.
- Customize wording to your district or audience.
- Replace placeholders (`X%`, `Y hours`, etc.) with your real metrics.
- Swap in real screenshots from the **live app** for visual slides.
- Keep text on each slide minimal; rely on speaker notes to tell the full story.
